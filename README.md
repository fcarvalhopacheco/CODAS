>A **CODAS** (Common Oceanographic Data Access System) database is a way to store and access oceanographic data. CODAS was developed in the late 1980's as a portable, self-describing format for oceanographic data, with emphasis on processed ADCP data.

>**CODAS processing** referes to the ADCP data processing sofwater and procedures that were developed around the CODAS format.
