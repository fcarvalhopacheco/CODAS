# Installing ``CODAS ADCP PROCESSING``

>*A **CODAS** (Common Oceanographic Data Access System) database is a way to store and access oceanographic data. CODAS was developed in the late 1980's as a portable, self-describing format for oceanographic data, with emphasis on processed ADCP data.

**CODAS processing** referes to the ADCP data processing sofwater and procedures that were developed around the CODAS format. The processing steps have become increasingly automated, but human judgement is still required for the final product, and the software is highly flexible in allowing manual configuration and execution of individual steps* ([UHDAS+CODAS Documentatiom](https://currents.soest.hawaii.edu/docs/adcp_doc/)



My idea is to simplify the installation procedure for CODAS processing avaiable [here](https://currents.soest.hawaii.edu/docs/adcp_doc/codas_setup/index.html)
